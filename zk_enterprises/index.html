    <h1>How Are We Different</h1>
    <p>
      ZK Enterprises aims to produce as much as possible while spending as little money as possible. We have been able to combine affordability and sustainability by utilising high-quality materials, placing a priority on safety precautions, and keeping an eye on the building sites. This has helped to prevent accidents and lower the cost of reworks and repairs. By reusing and recycling materials and incorporating them into construction as a practical choice, we also employ the greatest amount of resources possible when building.
    </p>
    <p id="scnd">
      We pledge to be the best construction firm so that working with us will benefit you. You won't simply get a finished project that is turnkey; you'll also get the best construction possible. Our customer support team is available around-the-clock if you have any queries or issues about active or finished projects.
    </p>

      <li class="one">
        <img src="./images/Business_Transparency.png" alt="Business Transparency">
        <h4>Business Transparency</h4>
        Being transparent is the best way to build trust. And, the two go hand in hand in every construction project. You can't take shortcuts in construction.
      </li>
      <li class="one">
        <img src="./images/End_to_End_Processing.png" alt="End to End Processing">
        <h4>End to End Processing</h4>
        End-to-end describes a process that takes a system or service from beginning to end and delivers a complete functional solution, usually without needing to obtain anything from a third party.
      </li>
      <li class="one">
        <img src="./images/Team_of_Experts.png" alt="Team of Experts">
        <h4>Team of Experts</h4>
        The construction team will normally form part of a larger project team which may include a project board, client representatives, design team and other stakeholders such as the buildingâ€™s users.
      </li>
      <li class="one">
        <img src="./images/No_Burden_on_Your_Budget.png" alt="No Burden on Your Budget">
        <h4>No Burden on Your Budget</h4>
        Developing a construction budget is usually done during a project's bidding stage. Making a budget is tedious as one has to look at bid documents and project plans to determine the total costs.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li class="two">
        <img src="./images/Handover_Promised.png" alt="Handover Promised">
        <h4>Handover Promised</h4>
        A major task today is getting the right handover from your developer/builder to the Residential Association/Society to ensure that there are no obstacles in the future.
      </li>
      <li class="two">
        <img src="./images/Quality.png" alt="Quality Check at Every Step">
        <h4>Quality Check at Every Step</h4>
        Construction quality control is a process that should be integrated into every project and refined as lessons are learned over time.
      </li>
      <li class="two">
        <img src="./images/No_Hidden_Charges.png" alt="No Hidden Charges">
        <h4>No Hidden Charges</h4>
        There are no hidden costs in construction, per se, there are only costs that are unknown to you personally. This directly relates to your degree of experience in the type of construction you are going to be involved with.
